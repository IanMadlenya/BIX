# BIX

<i>this is an experimental beta release of BIX. we are looking forward to receiving your feedback via mail (bix@robotfinance.org) or Twitter (https://twitter.com/RobotFinance)</i>

BIX is a decentralized global Bitcoin price index<br>
it's open, fast and free

<p><b>Our Goal:</b> building a distributed price feed with<br>
- 100% up-time (no single point of failure)<br>
- no single source of the trust </p>

<p>XBX is an open source alternative to TradeBlock's XBX index (see https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/). A proprietary index like XBX could have negative effects on Bitcoin market quality, because<br>
1. it can easily be manipulated by a central entity<br>
2. it can't be rebuilt at your own machine, so it does not only cost more money to consume Tradeblock's feed, it also adds latency to use data via TradeBlock's proxy server in NYC</p>

<p><b>Current exchange weightings:</b><br>
45% Bitfinex USD<br>
35% OKCoin USD<br>
20% Bitstamp USD<br>
